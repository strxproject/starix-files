## Starix Project Files
This repo is for the files that come on Starix Project.

Such as wallpapers, software and others.
### Can I use this on my own OS that I have installed?
Yes! You can as Starix Project is mostly customisation mods.
### How can I contribute?
You can make a community wallpaper with the resources in the `wallpapers/community` directory.

If you do end up making one, fork the repo, add your wallpaper in the `wallpapers/community` dir and make a PR.
